# Final Thoughts
The controls are very simple and the mood of the game does have a sense of darkness to it however, after completing 1 minute of each level you have to sit through a commercial each time which just destroys the emersion of the game. If the game didnâ€™t have these commercial popping up every so often I would properly enjoy it.
