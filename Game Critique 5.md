# Bugs
I'm not sure if I wasn't palying right or if it was a bug byt some of my cards that were on the board would not take an action such as attack or heal. It was really frustrating to try to play the same card as your oppent but the action would not process.
# Final Thoughts
The game relies on other people to play against which can be frustrating waiting in a long que for someone to wait several minutes for another person to play a quick match. Overall a well thought out game that does have interesting cards to play and create your own deck even though everyone without new cards will have a simailr deck.
