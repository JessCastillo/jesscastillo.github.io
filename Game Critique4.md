# Game Play Summary
## Playability
Playable but controls feel slow
### Single Player
### Controls
Mouse and Keyboard

# Bugs
Not any bugs that are too noticable during the few minutes of gameplay. The game has a long tutorial that takes you through a small story and forces you the use every feature before releasing you to the open world sandbox. 
# Final Thoughts
There is no dialog in the game besides the voical queues during gameplay. The game also has a fast forward feature to make the ship navigate faster but moving throughout the sandbox feels slow. Overall, not my cup of tea. If the gameplay felt faster and the controls were smoother the game could have a lot to offer but, it doesn't really grab the players attention in the first 15 minutes of gameplay.
