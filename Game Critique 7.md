# Final Thoughts
Overall this game had no sense of fun. The whole objective of the game is to find rings and put them in the barrel with ghost moving rings and the maze changing walls... There is a timer but that only times how long it takes you and there isn't a competiveness to it or a sense of urgency. The music is a repeative final fantasy explore song and overall just very boring to test.
