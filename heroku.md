The Heroku CI is a great tool that integrates with github that complies code and deploys it into a test app that can be easily edited and deployed again. For testing this is a great tool to run code and change it on the fly and then run again automatically. With the visual interface it makes it easy for user to understand the results. 
Using this application for an online game project allows the team to easily share and spend less time trying to figure out which portion of code doesn't work.
