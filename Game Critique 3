# Bugs
When loading into any map it appears that you are viewing the whole level under the actually map where you get that see through the floor effect but you are upside down(someone much have accidently moved the camera that is suppose to display the map).
When palying the conqure level you are suppose to fight against other players such as capture the check point until the timer runs out. Issue with this you can play the game by yourself without having to wait for people to join and you can leave any game mode without the timer running out with no reprecussions. 
# Final Thoughts
The game seem like it would be fun aganist other people or friends but it doesn't have a way to keeps players from willing leave the game. This game also requires heavly on other player to keep up the competiveness that is needed for multiplayer. Overall, at launch this game might be playable for a week and then drop off.
