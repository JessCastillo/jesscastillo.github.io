# Bugs
In the tutoral the NPC Ying guides the player movement wise but, the animation and facing direction is akward and she gets stuck on the assets of the level such as gates and walls.
# Final Thoughts
The game is very easy to play allowing new player to easily jump into a game after a short 5 minute tutorial. The only concern that I have with the game itself is the graphics/ 2D art quailty. Nothing about the art looks smooth even after turning up all the graphics to maxium, everything still looks pixelated.
